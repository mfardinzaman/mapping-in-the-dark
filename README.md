# Overview

Power outages are a widespread issue in the United States, affecting one in four households
in 2023[^1]. However, the scale, frequency, and distribution of outages may vary significantly
across regions and demographics. This project aims to provide an interactive data
visualization platform to explore power outages across U.S. counties from 2019 to 2023.
Through an interactive choropleth map, time-based exploration, and statistical charts, users
will be able to examine outage trends, identify anomalies such as during the COVID-19
pandemic, and analyze correlations between outages and racial demographics.
This visualization is designed with policymakers, infrastructure planners, and advocacy
groups in mind, hoping to provide insights that could help identify regions most in need of
power grid improvements. Additionally, it serves as a resource for the general public to
understand the intersectionality between power outages and their impact on different
communities. By making complex outage data more accessible, this project helps drive
informed discussions around energy infrastructure and identify imbalances in consistent
access to energy among various populations.
